# EasyShift Final Report
Final report for CSCI 483. Written by Travis MacDonald and Prahar Ijner.

## Introduction


## Background


## Additional efforts by authors
In addition to concepts covered in the course, we researched and implemented the following to produce the web application.

- Database implementation and connection
- Error handling
- Cascading style sheet
- Container management
- UI Components
  - DatePicker
  - Timeline
  - Card
  - Dialog
  - TabMenu
  - Ajax - partial rendering and processing

## Website design and workflow

![Implemented workflow](../resources/easyShift.png)

### Home page (landing page)

### Login page

### Registration page

### Dashboard-menu

### Dashboard home

### Dashboard calendar

### Dashboard edit-events

### Logout

### Styling
To ensure consistent design patterns and colors throughout the web pages, we defined a style sheet (see `project/src/main/webapp/styles.css`). This tool significantly aided us in improving the visual appeal of the application and setting parameters to distinguish calendar events, i.e., available and scheduled events.

### Database
